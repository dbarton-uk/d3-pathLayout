The example shows the d3-pathLayout plugin fitting an array of nodes to custom SVG paths.

Each path is represented by a dotted light grey line, and each node is represented by a letter. For each path, d3-pathLayout positions each node and the example then transitions the nodes to the calculated position.

Source code for the plugin available [here](http://www.github.com/dbarton-uk/d3-pathLayout).
